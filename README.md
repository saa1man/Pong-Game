To control the pads, the commands are too easy as you can see below:

 - For the right pad press 'Up Arrow' key to move up and 'Down Arrow' key to go down

 - For the left pad press 'w' key to move up and 's' key to go down

I hope you enjoy trying it..

ps: If you tried it, please let me know by leaving a review.
    Thanks!
